basics
======

Mesos is built using the same principles as the Linux kernel, only at a different level of abstraction. 

The Mesos kernel runs on every machine and provides applications (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elasticsearch) with APIâ€™s for resource management and scheduling across entire datacenter and cloud environments.

- Linear scalability
   - Industry proven to easily scale to 10,000s of nodes.

- High availability
   - Fault-tolerant replicated master and agents using Zookeeper. Non-disruptive upgrades.

- Containers
   - Native support for launching containers with Docker and AppC images.

- Pluggable isolation
   - First-class isolation support for CPU, memory, disk, ports, GPU, and modules for custom resource isolation.

- Two-level scheduling
   - Support for running cloud-native and legacy applications in the same cluster with pluggable scheduling policies.

- APIs
   - HTTP APIs for developing new distributed applications, for operating the cluster, and for monitoring.

- Web UI
    - Built-in Web UI for viewing cluster state and navigating container sandboxes.

- Cross-Platform
   - Runs on Linux, OSX and Windows. 

   - Cloud provider agnostic.
